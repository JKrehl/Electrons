Scripts and programs for TEM scattering simulation and tomographic reconstruction.

As a non-public repository the scripts are largely undocumented and partially not working. Of course all copyright remains with Jonas Krehl, except for the lsqr.py and lsmr.py in Tomography/Solvers which are adapted from Scipy.
